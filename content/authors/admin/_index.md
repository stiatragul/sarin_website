I like learning about how organisms come to be the way they are and how we can appropriately care for them today and into the future. I enjoy the challenge of working in aspects of biology that are overlooked (could be said about every aspect I suppose), making scientific knowledge understandable for people around the world and bringing people together to do something useful. 

Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Keogh Lab](http://keoghlab.com). at the Australian National University (ANU). My thesis focuses on the evolutionary relationships among Australian blind snakes (genus *Anilios*). Before ANU, I completed my M.S. in Biological Sciences at Auburn University supervised by Dr. Dan Warner [Warner Lab](http://warnerlab.weebly.com/people.html).

Besides research, I am keen on photography, scuba diving, football (soccer), and seeing as much of the world as possible. I enjoy spending time in nature and immersing myself into different cultures to appreciate the (bio)diversity of life. I also ocassionally host a Thai radio program on CMS Radio.
