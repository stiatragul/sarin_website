abstract: Northern FlickerWoodpeckers encompass 210 species of birds best known for
  their distinctive \"head-banging\" behavior. They belong to the order Piciformes
  and the family Picidae, which can be found worldwide except for Madagascar, Australia,
  New Guinea, New Zealand, and the polar regions. Alabama is home to eight species
  of woodpeckers, with a ninth species, the ivory-billed woodpecker, widely believed
  to be extirpated.
