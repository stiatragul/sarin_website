They belong to the order Piciformes and the family Picidae, which can be found worldwide except for Madagascar, Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, and the polar regions. Alabama is home to eight species of woodpeckers, with a ninth species, the ivory-billed woodpecker, widely believed to be extirpated."
