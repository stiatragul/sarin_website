abstract: The transformation of natural habitats into urban landscapes dramatically
  alters thermal environments, which in turn, can impact local biota. Ectothermic
  organisms that are oviparous are particularly sensitive to these altered environments
  because their embryos cannot behaviorally thermoregulate and the surrounding environment
  determines the temperature experienced during development. We studied the effects
  of urban and forested thermal environments on embryo development and hatchling phenotypes
  in two non-native lizards (Anolis sagrei and A. cristatellus) in metropolitan Miami,
  Florida. To determine if embryos from urban and forested sites are adapted to their
  respective thermal environments, we incubated eggs from each site using temperatures
  that simulate likely nest conditions in both urban and forested environments. For
  both species, urban thermal environments accelerated embryonic development, but
  had no impact on egg survival or any of the phenotypic traits that were measured
  (e.g., body size, running performance, and locomotor behavior). Our results provide
  no evidence that embryos from urban and forested sites are adapted to their respective
  thermal environments. Instead, the lack of any major effects suggest that embryos
  of both species are physiologically robust with respect to novel environments, which
  could have facilitated their success in establishing in non-native ranges and in
  human-modified landscapes.
