abstract: Maternal nesting behavior in oviparous species strongly influences the environmental
  conditions their embryos experience during development. In turn, these early-life
  conditions have consequences for offspring phenotypes and many fitness components
  across an individual's lifespan. Thus, identifying the evolutionary and ecological
  causes and effects of nesting behavior is a key goal of behavioral ecology. Studies
  of reptiles have contributed greatly to our understanding of how nesting behavior
  shapes offspring phenotypes. While some taxonomic groups have been used extensively
  to provide insights into this important area of biology, many groups remain poorly
  studied. For example, the squamate genus Anolis has served as a model to study behavior,
  ecology, and evolution, but research focused on Anolis nesting behavior and developmental
  plasticity is comparatively scarce. This dearth of empirical research may be attributed
  to logistical challenges (e.g., difficulty locating nests), biological factors (e.g.,
  their single-egg clutches may hinder some experimental designs), and a historical
  focus on males in Anolis research. Although there is a gap in the literature concerning
  Anolis nesting behavior, interest in nesting ecology and developmental plasticity
  in this group has grown in recent years. In this paper, we (1) review existing studies
  of anole nesting ecology and developmental plasticity; (2) highlight areas of anole
  nesting ecology that are currently understudied and discuss how research in these
  areas can contribute to broader topics (e.g., maternal effects and global change
  biology); and (3) provide guidelines for studying anole nesting in the field. Overall,
  this review provides a foundation for establishing anoles as models to study nesting
  ecology and developmental plasticity.
