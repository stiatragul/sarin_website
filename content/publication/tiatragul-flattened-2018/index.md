abstract: The flattened musk turtle (Sternotherus depressus) is a small species of
  aquatic turtle that is found only in Alabama. They occur exclusively above the fall
  line in the upper Black Warrior River Basin and are Alabama's only endemic (meaning
  found only there) reptile species. The turtle's limited range and specific habitat
  requirements make the species especially vulnerable to habitat degradation and loss.
  Flattened musk turtles are listed as \"critically endangered\" on the International
  Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and as a \"threatened\" under the
  U.S.
publication: '*Encyclopedia of Alabama*'
