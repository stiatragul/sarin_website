 abstract = {The flattened musk turtle (Sternotherus depressus) is a small species of aquatic turtle that is found only in Alabama. They occur exclusively above the fall line in the upper Black Warrior River Basin and are Alabama's only endemic (meaning found only there) reptile species. The turtle's limited range and specific habitat requirements make the species especially vulnerable to habitat degradation and loss. Flattened musk turtles are listed as "critically endangered" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and as a "threatened" under the U.S.},
