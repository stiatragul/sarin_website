abstract: Human activity causes major changes in natural landscapes via introduction
  of non-native species, development on natural habitat, and alteration of local weather
  patterns. These factors contribute to global change and may interact to affect local
  populations of plants and animals. We studied a viable, non-native lizard population
  (Anolis sagrei) in southeast Alabama, USA that has depended upon thermal conditions
  inside a greenhouse nursery during the winter for at least 10~years. Using Capture-Mark-Recapture
  surveys, we compared population parameters and movement patterns of this introduced
  A. sagrei population to a native lizard population (Sceloporus undulatus) that also
  inhabits our study site. The population size of both species fluctuated over time,
  but that of A. sagrei was considerably larger than S. undulatus. Anolis sagrei was
  relatively philopatric and confined within the greenhouse and its immediate vicinity,
  whereas the S. undulatus population extended into the surrounding forest habitat.
  The thermal landscape within the greenhouse was substantially altered after the
  roof was removed due to winds from a tropical storm. Indeed, temperatures of all
  microhabitats commonly used by lizards frequently dropped below the critical thermal
  minimum for A. sagrei and below freezing during winter. Post-winter surveys revealed
  that no A. sagrei individuals survived, indicating that the temperature change in
  the greenhouse resulted in extinction. The native S. undulatus population, however,
  was still present after winter. Our study provides rare documentation of an extinction
  of an established introduced population and illustrates the role that human-made
  structures and natural weather events play in the process of biological invasion.
