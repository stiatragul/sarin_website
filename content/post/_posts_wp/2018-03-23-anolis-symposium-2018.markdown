We just got back from hot and tropical Miami this week with heaps of lizards! Last week three current and a former graduate student attended the 2018Â _Anolis Symposium_ at Fairchild Tropical Botanical Gardens. Hats off to the organizers, James Stroud and Anthony Geneva. Phil presented a poster on his recently published [paper](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1874/20180256) in Proceedings B about the benefit of early hatching. Jenna made a full debut in the lizard world with a side project testing potential effects of egg aggregation using brown anole eggs. Josh gave the final presentation summing up what we know about reproductive phenology in anoles and I gave a presentation on anole nest microenvironment differences between urban and forested sites.

After the symposium, we collected a bunch of lizards for a couple projects this summer. Stay tuned for updates! I met a lot of awesome scientists there and was very thankful to have the chance to talk to Sean Doody about eggs, Stu Nielsen about all sorts of herps, Colin Donihue about hurricanes, and many more!
