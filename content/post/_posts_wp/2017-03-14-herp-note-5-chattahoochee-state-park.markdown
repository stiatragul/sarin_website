Last weekend I got to go out to Chattahoochee State Park (border of Florida and Alabama) with the 13 students from Herpetology class lab by [Brian Folt](https://guyerlab.wordpress.com/brian-folt/). Our goal was to check out the wetlands (possible habitats for the one-toed amphiuma and sirens).

Over the course of two days, we saw over 14 species of herps, some of which I've witness for the first time:



	  * common snapping turtle
	  * Common cooter turtles
	  * Squirrel tree frog
