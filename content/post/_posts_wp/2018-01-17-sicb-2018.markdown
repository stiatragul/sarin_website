Happy New Year!

2017 was an amazing year filled with new experiences and friendships. None of it would have been possible without the support of my family and the Warner Lab.

2018 started out fresh with the the Warner Lab taking the 2018 Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting in San Francisco. I gave my [first talk](http://www.anoleannals.org/2018/01/08/sicb-2018-moms-help-embryos-beat-the-heat/) about my study on anole nest sites in urban areas. I also attended many great talks and got to catch up with my previous professors from Gonzaga!
