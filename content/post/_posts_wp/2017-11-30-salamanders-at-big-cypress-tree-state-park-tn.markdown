Since our university was on Thanksgiving Break (3rd week of November). I had the honour of visiting Josh Hall's family in West Tennessee. Josh and I collaborate on a series of projects to study how invasive lizards might be adapted to urban adaptation so we've gone down to Miami, FL together a couple times. While we share many common interests and values, one stark difference between us is our views on big cities. I really like big cities because I grew up in one. However, Josh doesn't share that affinity for busy streets and skyscrapers.

My trip to Josh's hometown of Milan (pronounce "Mai-Lan" unlike the Italian city) gave me a better idea of our difference! On Thanksgiving Day, Josh showed me the whole town in 20 minutes! Then we came home to celebrate Thanksgiving with the entire family. We had plenty of delicious food and dessert while sharing all sorts of stories.

The day after Thanksgiving we went to Big Cypress Tree State Park. The park was named so because there use to be a Big Cypress tree but it unfortunately burnt down years ago. However, there is still lots of cypress tree and the swamp is great salamander habitat! Joined by Jordan (Josh's friend) and Hazel (picture below), we went for a stomp in the woods on a cool sunny morning. According to Josh, time seems to slow down in the swamp as you're surrounded by the serene background of cypress trees.

Without too much effort, we found three species of salamanders, the Mole salamander (_Ambystoma_ talpoideum)_,_ a small-mouth salamander (_Ambystoma texanum_), and the spotted salamander (_Ambystoma opacum_).

We then spent a couple hours enjoying the morning before heading home!
