A team of researchers showed that the red-footed tortoise were able to remember how to associate colour with food after 18 months they were first taught to do so.

The results from this [_paper_](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/2/20160853) suggest that reptiles may be capable more long-term memory than what we previously believed.
