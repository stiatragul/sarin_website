Last weekend I had a chance to go out to Halawakee Creek's 1st order stream again with the good people from the [Warner Lab](http://warnerlab.weebly.com/). We did about an hour of searching on an overcast day and found 22 _P. websteri_ a slimy salamander, a ring-neck snake, and two Two-line salamanders. We also found what appeared to be a bullfrog.
