November is one of my favorite months.

The first week of November, one week before my thesis defense seminar, I went with my lab mate Josh back down to Miami to revisit my field site. It was great to see the lizards there again and gave me good opportunities to take pictures while Josh is catching anoles for his experiment.

We had a successful trip and was even able to squeeze a quick visit to the Everglades National Park the day after.

On the 8th November, I defended my thesis!

I had a great time and I really appreciate everyone who came out to support!
