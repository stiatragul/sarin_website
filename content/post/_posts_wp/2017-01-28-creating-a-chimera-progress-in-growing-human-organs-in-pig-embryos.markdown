Is it possible to grow human organs in another animal? Scientists from the Salk Institute reckon they are a step closer in doing so. This leads us closer to the reality where human organs can be grown from in a lab and transplanted into people who need a new organ.<!-- more -->

In a **_[research paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416317524)_** published in _Cell, _the researchers from Salk Institute was able to insert human [stem cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2iXpoG5j8) (which are cells that has the potential to turn into any cell) into a developing embryo of a pig and see human cells starting to grow and divide.

However, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, the lead scientist in this project admits that we are still far away from creating a fully functional organ. Nonetheless, they believe that this is a great first step.

What do you think?
