This past weekend I attended the 2018 Annual Southeast Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation meeting at Unicoi State Park, Helen, GA. I had a stimulating time going to talks, presenting, reconnecting with friends and meeting new people who are enthusiastic about herpetofauna.

The setting for this conference was great. Unicoi State Park had plenty to offer in terms of hiking, herping, and birding. Helen, the town nearby features Bavarian architecture, which reminded me of Wenatchee, Washington.

I was very happy to meet David McLeod (James Madison University) and his students Althea and Sarah. David use to work for many years in Thailand and humbled me by his knowledge of Thai herpetofauna! I also have John Maerz to thank for telling me more about the ICON program at UGA. This rigorous program is an exciting opportunity for anyone who wants to take an integrated approach to conservation.

Coming back from this meeting, I'm energized to learn more about what I can do to conserve herpetofauna in Thailand. Also in the Southeast...but Southeast Asia. But for now...it's finishing up our manuscript from last summer's project! I intend to get back to posting more frequently on this blog!
