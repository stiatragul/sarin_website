I graduated from Auburn at the end of 2018. Since, I've been spending time with my parents, visiting friends, and traveling.

Currently, I'm in Kingston (Jamaica) helping [James Stroud](http://www.jameststroud.com/) a postdoctoral fellow in the Losos Lab set up his project on this wonderful island.

This is the first Caribbean country I've ever been to and it's a privilege to see meet the people and see wildlife here. Among the fauna of interest are five species of anoles (in theÂ _Anolis _or_ Norops_ genus if you go by Nicholson et al. 2018) and birds that cannot be found naturally elsewhere. Here are photos of (left)_ opalinus _and (right)_ grahami_:

Other species of anoles include _lineatopus_, _valenciani_ (the twig anole baby picture below), and reconditus (this one we haven't seen)!

I also spotted a Northern potoo (_Nyctibius jamaicensis_), which was very well camouflaged as a tree stump! Follow [@derpetology](https://www.instagram.com/derpetology/) on Instagram by Jon Suh for some fantastic photos of animals we found during this trip.
