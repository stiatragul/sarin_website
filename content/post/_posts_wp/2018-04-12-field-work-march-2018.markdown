The Warner Lab just wrapped up the first 2018 field trip. The main objectives for this trip include collecting lizards for Jenna's project, taking way-point averages of trees on some of Dan's islands, introducing our new post-doc Amelie to the study system, and clearing Tim's CB1 and CB2 islands

I was there for 6 days this time around and was involved with everything mentioned above. Well, I was primarily taking GPS coordinates for trees.

It was also a reunion in many ways! 1) My friend Joe from Gonzaga visits and comes out to the field with us. 2) Tim Mitchell also joins the Warner Lab to wrap up his Crescent Beach project!
