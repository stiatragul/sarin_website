## Make your work available on request
<!-- First, it's illegal to post PDFs of the publications (all that aren't open access at least) on your website. So, I cannot recommend that you do it. But I can tell you my reasoning for doing it, and my experience. My reasoning is exactly the same as yours. My experience is that it's been comforting to me to have the PDFs out there. I occasionally worry that I'll get in trouble for it, but it hasn't happened yet. I think (I don't know though) the worst that is likely to happen is that I am sent a 'cease and desist' kind of letter by e.g. Elsevier and am told to take the papers down. In principle I could get in more trouble than this, and I guess that could happen if they decide to make an example out of someone. My feeling has always been that the latter seems unlikely. In the end I consider this simply civil disobedience, and of a useful kind. So I am willing to run the small but non-zero risk of getting in trouble. 

It's hard to find the right balance, as a PhD student and throughout your career, between doing what is considered good for your career, and doing what you think is right. Ultimately, you have to eat, and you have to sleep at night. And this seems to me to be the balance. So far I haven't found anything to be a deal breaker that would make me leave science altogether, but I did quit my first PhD, and also my first faculty job, because there were things about those particular positions that were deal breakers for me. When it comes to balancing open access and careers though, I think there are a few really good options. -->

## Preprints
<!-- First, post preprints. This means that no matter what, a near final version of your paper (and you can update the preprint to the final version) will always be available for free. On your website you could point to the preprint version and state that the text and figures are identical to the published version. That seems to me like it would solve most of your problems. Perhaps there are some journals that won't allow preprints. My take on that is that those journals can just fuck off. If you like, think of this as leadership. We ignore them with our excellent science (and your science is excellent) until they stop being so silly.  -->

## Open access journals
<!-- Second, publish in journals that allow open access, and try to find the funds to pay for it. Talk to Scott about funding this. It can be expensive, but it's sometimes possible to get waivers if you aim for journals that are fully open access. There are many really excellent journals in our field that are both hybrid and fully open access. So it's usually just the money that's an issue. 

I think for now the best thing is to try as hard as you can to get this right. But my advice would be to keep expectations of others in mind too. I.e. I would not recommend simply publishing everything in PeerJ. I wish I could recommend that, but I think that for no really good reason (merely others' misperceptions) it would be career suicide. 

The more you do in this area, the more you are helping to change science for the better. None of us are perfect though, and sometimes compromises are worthwhile.

I hope some of that helps! It's something I've thought about a great deal, and am still finding my way. -->
