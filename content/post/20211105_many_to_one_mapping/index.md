Notes from reading:
Wainwright, P. C. 2007. Functional Versus Morphological Diversity in Macroevolution. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 38:381â€“401.

## Intro:
- Some features of organismal design influence diversity. 
  - How does this affect patterns and cause of morphological diversity across the tree of life?

- Empirical studies of functional diversity is not common in 2007. 
  - Beacuse difficult to get data on a variety of taxa...but simulations possible.

- "How innovation in design and the nature of form-function relationship impact evolution of diversity in functional systems"?
  - Novelties are not equally potent, breakthroughs in functional design -> changes ecology and evolution of lineages. 
    - E.g feather crest on birds may have less of an effect compared to powered flight or endothermy
    - Multicellularity, genome duplications, body segmentations, flowers, jaws.

How do we go about testing the influence of these innovations on diversity and their effects on macroevolution?

### Performance, function and morphology

- Performance traits are target of natural selection - usually consist of complex basis in size, shape, and other properties
- Functional properties = emergent physiological and mechanical properties of component parts.
  - e.g. Mechanical advantage of lever system (claws) ratio of input lever divided by output lever. 
- Function diversity = diversity in functional properties, not diversity in underlying parts.
- Functional properties underlie performance
  - Clear when simple mechanical basis but not clear when behaviour mediates
    - e.g. jump performance determined by muscculoskeletal design BUT also motivation (behaviour).

### Hierarchical nature of performance
- "Most proximal measure are directly linked to particular system and the highest-order traits involving the integration of multiple functional systems"
- Locomotion as an example
  - force output from leg muscle can be estimated from morphological measurements EVEN WITHOUT knowing anything about biochemistry. 
  - Sprint speed = combination of many muscles
    - ability to escape predator depend partly on sprint speed, because also agility and response to predator movements.
  - Fitness is the ultimate performance trait, integrating all performance properties.

### Trade-offs to adaptive diversity
- Organismal design involves trade-offs. 
  - Some are in construction of individual systems. 
    - Mechanical and physiological mecahnisms involve inherence trade-offs. Improve performance in one thing, cost another thing.
    - e.g. Mechanical advantage -- when ratio of input to output lever increase, force transmision of the system increases, but amount of movement that is transmitted through system decreases. 
    - Innovation that qualitatively changes the design that decouples two performance traits that are linked to trade-off is significant. 

### Categories of innovations that can influence diversity
1. Innovations that directly influence potential for phenotypic variation.
  - Change potential morphospace of body plan posessed by the lineage
2. Innovations that allow lineage to move into new regions of the adaptive landscape
  - allow lineage to move into novel region of the adaptive landscape, where variety of new adaptive peaks can be reached. 

Species richness vs morphological diversity, functional diversity, and ecological diversity. 
- Morphological and functional diversity are measured as variance among members of the group under consideration (Foote 1997).

### Expanding theoretical morphospace
  - Potential morphospace occupied by a body plan is determined by many independent parameters.
  - e.g. mollusk shells are defined by 3 parameters. A novelty that increases the number of parameters leads to increase in potential morphospace and opportunity for greater diversity.
  - for example... structural duplication or subdivision that increase elements that make up the form
    - Body segmentation -> body regions with same basic plan but modified
      - Arthropods body segmented into units each with axial structures and limb elements.
        - Decapod shrimps (walking parts, swimming parts). 
    - Can test whether duplication events result in higher phenotypic diversity among lineages within that clade compared to sister clade that lacks duplication. 
  - Redundancy creates potential for different body segments to perform difference function (burst location vs walking) -> Functional decoupling can enchance diversity 
    - When walking and burst swimming are decoupled, adaptation for perfroamnce is not constrained by the need for a single region to maintain BOTH. 
  - When a single anatomical system is required to perform multiple functions, it is a CONSTRAINT on evolutionary diversification, so decoupling is major avenue of increasing diversity. 
    - Examples
      - introduction of wings released constraint on hindlimbs...hindlimbs can before specialised because wings do the locomotor part. 
      - Pharyngal jaws in cichlids allow second set of jaws to specialise in prey processingm so the oral jaw can specialise in prey capture.

### Nature of Form-function map
- Some intrinsic design features can relieve functional constraints on anatomical system even without duplication events. 
- Many-to-one mapping of morphology to function.
  - Multiple morphology canhave same functional property, when functional property DEPENDS on 3+ underlying parameters instead of 1 or 2 parameters. 
    - Even two parameters show many-to-one mapping. 
      - e.g. mechanical advantage of muscle acting across a joint:
        - MA is ratio of two distances (input lever and output lever), but when we add input force exerted by muscle and the output force is input force * ratio of input lever to output lever (3 parameters).
- Many-to-one mapping shown in many phenotypes like suction index (SI) = capacity for a fish to generate suction pressure during feeding. 
  - SI based on strength of muscle and morphology of linkage system that transmit force to expanding mouth cavity during suction feeding. 
- Leads to macroevolutionary expectations;
  1. Many-to-one mapping can partially decouple accumulation of morphological and mechanical diversity within clades.
    - SI in may not vary among species, but parameters that make up SI are different. 
    - MORPHOLOGICAL diversity should NOT be used as proxy for functional diversity

### Intrinsic relationship between form and function that influence diversity

### Recent methods to compare phenotypic diversity between phylogenetic groups accounting for differences in time and shared history within lineages
