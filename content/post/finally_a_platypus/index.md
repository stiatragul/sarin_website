Visited Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve yesterday with a few mates and finally saw the platypus at "The Santuary." It's a priviledge to see them up close because they are usually very secretive and often show up very far away. However, this one we saw was up close and I was able to snap this photo!

Nearby, I saw this Crested shrike-tit (Australian shriketit or *Falcunculus frontatus*) tearing apart and eating a caterpillar.

Also this Welcome swallow!
