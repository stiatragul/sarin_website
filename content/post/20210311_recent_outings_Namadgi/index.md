Last weekend we went to Namadgi National Park in the hopes of finding the eastern pygmy possum (*Cercartetus nanus*). We ended up finding one around 21:00 close to the Lower Cotter Catchment. 
Tim Bonnet posted an observation on [Canberra Nature Map](https://canberra.naturemapr.org/sightings/4374563). The pygmy possum is one of the most adorable mammals I’ve witness in person. The not so good news that came out from all of this is that once we came back to our car, we found that some people have deflated car tyre (one tyre on each of your vehicle). Thankfully, there were no punctures and we were able to change the tyre and got out of the National Park.


## From January

In January I meant to post this but forgot…so here it goes!

A bit of a late post but we found 2 Anilios nigrescens in Namadgi National Park. One looked like a male and the other like a female based on tail length. Tim reported the sighting on Canberra Nature Map as well.
