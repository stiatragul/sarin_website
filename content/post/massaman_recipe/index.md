# Why did I write this recipe?

This is one of my favourite curries growing up. My grandmother lived with us when she was alive and growing up I would see her cook up a huge pot and slow cook it on top of charcoal. The smell was always wonderful. I wish I had learned from her, but as a boy I was barred from getting close to the open fire! Once I started going to university abroad, this was one of the dishes that I missed. I usually cook it by using commercial pre-made paste from the stores and they are reliably tasty. It was not until 2019 (at the division of Research School of Biology - Ecology & Evolution annual Curry Night) that I tried making paste from raw ingredients and it turns out alright! 

Here's the recipe for those interested (instructions on where to shop are tailored for those living in Canberra but you should be able to find ingredients where you live, hopefully).

The original recipe can be found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBgG09x7tIE.
You can find more great recipes at: www.krua.co (they are all in Thai).

You will need a mortar for this or very good food processor.

## Ingredients (and suggestions for where to find them)

You can get the more 'rare' ingredients from '*Capital Groceries*' (1, Block, 8 Purdue St, Belconnen ACT 2617) or '*Angkor Wat*' next to Woolies in West Field Belconnen. These are just the ones I know about. 

500 g of meat

5 cups light coconut milk

1 cup thick coconut milk

½ cup curry paste (we will make this))

½ cup palm sugar (*Angkor Wat* or Capital Groceries)

8 Tbsp tamarind juice (Angkor Wat* or Capital Groceries)

5 Tbsp fish sauce (Angkor Wat* or Capital Groceries)

2 tsp sea salt

250 g  potato, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks

2 Tbsp peanuts, boiled or roasted

1 onion, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

3 roasted siam (round) cardamoms (may be a bit hard to find so use whatever you can find)

For the curry paste (makes ½ cup)

1 ½ tsp coriander seeds, roasted and ground

½ tsp cumin seeds, roasted and ground 

4 cloves, roasted and ground

4 siam (round) cardamom, seeds roasted and ground

1 cinnamon stick (1-inch long), roasted and ground

1 nutmeg mace, roasted and ground

½ tsp white peppercorns, roasted and ground

10 dried spur chilies, seeded and soaked to soften (Angkor Wat* or Capital Groceries)

½ tsp sea salt

1 Tbsp finely sliced mature galangal 

2 stalks lemongrass, finely sliced (sometimes Coles or Woolies have them, 
otherwise Angkor Wat* or Capital Groceries should)

1 tsp finely chopped  zest of kaffir lime (A few shops in Dickson sells this)

25 cloves Thai garlic, peeled

5 shallots, peeled and sliced

1 tsp shrimp paste (a few shops in Dickson sells this so does Angkor Wat* or Capital Groceries)


## Instruction for making curry paste

1. **Roast and ground the following**. Once finish, set aside.
    * coriander seeds, roasted and ground
    * cumin seeds, roasted and ground 
    * cloves, roasted and ground
    * siam (round) cardamom, seeds roasted and ground
    * cinnamon stick (1-inch long), roasted and ground
    * nutmeg mace, roasted and ground
    * tsp white peppercorns, roasted and ground

1. **In a mortar, crush/ground these together** 
    * dried spur chilies, seeded and soaked to soften
    * tsp sea salt
    * Tbsp finely sliced mature galangal 
    * stalks lemongrass, finely sliced
    * tsp finely chopped  zest of kaffir lime
    * cloves garlic, peeled
    * shallots (shallot onions), peeled and sliced
    * tsp shrimp paste (optional)

## Putting everything together

1. Mix well everything from the first two steps together.

1. In a pan, fry the paste with some oil and *coconut cream.*

1. If adding meat, do that after the paste + oil + coconut cream starts to smell nice. 

1. Add *coconut milk* (notice this is not cream) to the pot.

1. Cook for 15 minutes then add diced vegetables (potatoes, carrots, whatever you want) and peanuts (can use cashews too if you can afford).

1. Simmer for a while until vegetables are soft. You might need to wait longer if cooking meat like lamb, beef, or kangaroo. The longer you let simmer, the better it is, I think. But you don't want to wait so long that the vegetables all turn to mush! 

1. That's it, serve over hot *jasmine rice* (or whatever rice you want just make sure you cook it)!
