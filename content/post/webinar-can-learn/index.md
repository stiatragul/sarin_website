### Here are the **3** valuable lessons I learned from hosting 'Dek ACT' that may be helpful for the age of video conferences:

1. Talk as if you're talking to one person.

A lof of people have this image that being on radio is like standing on a stage with a loud microphone addressing a crowd of interested listeners. Realistically, you are only talkig to one person, the listener. Addressing listeners directly with words like 'you' and 'your' can help make the show feel more personal and retain their attention more. If you are doing a webinar, your listeners are probably isolated. I think presenters will benefit from addressing the listeners directly. 

2. A narrative 


3. Audio editing, a transferable skill for hosting a podcasts!

Most of our shows are live, but ever since COVID-19 restrictions we have been pre-recording our shows using our mobile phones. I then download the audio clips and mesh them together with Audacity (free and open source)! I found it surprisingly intuitive and relatively easy to edit the show
